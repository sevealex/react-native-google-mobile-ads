      # You need an artifact id to get a download link for it.
      # You need a workflow run id to get an artifact id.
      # You need to list out all runs for a workflow and filter to get the run id.
      # This action does all of that but needs a tweak to just kick out the URL instead of downloading:
      # https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact/blob/master/main.js#L102
      # Best strategy is to run this patch generator on pull_request
      # Then run the issue commenter that dynamically de-references the artifact on workflow_run
